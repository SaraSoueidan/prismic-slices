**Prismic Slices** is a library of vanilla components that I developed in collaboration with the Prismic team, as part of the SliceMachine open source project. These components are page sections such as carousels, FAQ sections, hero sections, CTA, etcâ€¦

The components in this library are vanilla components â€” no JavaScript frameworks or libraries are used or required as dependencies. If you are more into React or Vue then you might want to checkout [Slicemachine.dev](slicemachine.dev). With SliceMachine, you can build page sections, define their model, edit their properties, deploy them, and deliver a visual interface that allows even your most technically challenged colleagues to easily build pages without any further help from you.

As youâ€™d expect, these components are built with responsiveness, browser compatibility and accessibility in mind. I built this library of components to be a resilient foundation for your projects. They are progressively enhanced, cross-browser compatible, responsive, accessible, and customizable components, created with semantic markup, modern CSS, JavaScript, and lots of love ðŸ’œ.

The library is built using [Fractal](fractal.build). You can get it up and running pretty quickly:

```
npm install
```
and then

```
npm start
```
