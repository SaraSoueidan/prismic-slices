# Prismic Slices

**Prismic Slices** is a library of vanilla components that I developed in collaboration with the Prismic team, as part of the [SliceMachine open source project](https://github.com/prismicio/slice-machine). These components are page sections such as carousels, FAQ sections, hero sections, CTA, etcâ€¦

The components in this library are vanilla components â€” no JavaScript frameworks or libraries are used or required as dependencies. If you are more into React or Vue then you can find their equivalents for these frameworks on [Slicemachine.dev](https://slicemachine.dev). With SliceMachine, you can build page sections, define their model, edit their properties, deploy them, and deliver a visual interface that allows even your most technically challenged colleagues to easily build pages without any further help from you.

As youâ€™d expect, these components are built with responsiveness, browser compatibility and accessibility in mind. I built this library of components to be a resilient foundation for your projects. They are progressively enhanced, cross-browser compatible, responsive, accessible, and customizable components, created with semantic markup, modern CSS, JavaScript, and lots of love ðŸ’œ.

## Installing 

The library is built using [Fractal](https://fractal.build). To install and run with a live dev server:

```
npm install
```
and then

```
npm start
```
